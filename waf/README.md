# DDoS Prevention using AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Scenario: Let's say a maliscious user is flooding your API gateway with requests, overwhelming and disrupting your ability to serve real customers and perform normal operations.

Goal: In this project, we will use a Web Application Firewall to limit the chance for DDoS attacks. With this firewall, we will institute a rate limit rule which analyzes metadata of requests that are occuring at a high frequency and effectively blocking them for a period of time in order to stop them from overwhelming an application.
